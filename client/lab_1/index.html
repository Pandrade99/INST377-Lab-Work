<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes you want to <i><strong>do both.</strong></i>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
